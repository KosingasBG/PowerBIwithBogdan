The first measure is:
  DAX
    Revenue This Year = 
      CALCULATE(
          [Total Revenue],
          YEAR('Calendar ðŸ“…'[Date]) = YEAR(TODAY())
      )
The second measure is:
DAX
  Previous Year Revenue = 
    CALCULATE(
      [Total Revenue],
      YEAR('Calendar ðŸ“…'[Date])=YEAR(TODAY())-1
            )

To calculate delta, use this DAX formula:
  DAX
    Delta Revenue = 
    [Revenue This Year] - [Previous Year Revenue]

Delta Revenue % = 
  DIVIDE([Delta Revenue], [Previous Year Revenue], 0) * 100

Î” PY = 
  VAR arrow_up = UNICHAR(9650)
  VAR arrow_down = UNICHAR(9660)
  VAR delta = [Delta Revenue]
  RETURN
  IF(delta > 0,
      FORMAT(ROUND(delta, 0), "$#,###") & " " & arrow_up,
      FORMAT(ROUND(delta, 0), "$#,###") & " " & arrow_down
  )
